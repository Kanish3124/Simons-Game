# Simons-Game
A memory-based game where players replicate an increasing sequence of colors. Each level adds a new color, making it harder. This project demonstrates JavaScript, HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation, event handling, and animations, with jQuery for easy DOM interaction and sound effects for feedback.
